### 2. Limited Developer Attribution

Models are associated with one country and one organization, even if developed collaboratively across multiple entities. In regional groupings, the cross-regional collaboration category may generalize trends and oversimplify the global and cross-sector nature of model development.

### 3. Transparency Score is simplified

The score reflects only four components: training data, dataset size, training compute, and parameter count. It does not capture the full spectrum of model documentation and downstream impacts. 

### 4. Time lag and partial year data

Recent years (especially 2024-2025) may be underrepresented due to reporting delays or ongoing development. Scores for these years should be interpreted with caution. 

### 5. Sample bias

Results may be skewed by small sample sizes in some regions, organization types, and model accessibility types. High transparency in certain categories may reflect a few well-documented models rather than widespread practices. 

### 6. Region groupings 

The regional groupings in this analysis follow the World Bank typology, which is also adopted in Stanford HAIâ€™s latest AI Index report. These groupings are not based on AI capacities, as there is no existing AI regions typology, but are intended to provide a standardized framework for categorizing regions based on general geographic and economic characteristics.
