This map visualizes the average transparency score of models by country, based on country-level information recorded in the dataset. Filtering by year enables the exploration of how national transparency patterns evolve over time, especially in response to governance shifts or research trends.

What the Map Reveals:

- Countries like Russia, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates present perfect scoresâ€”likely reflecting a small number of well-documented, research-focused models 
- Switzerland, Japan, and India lead among countries with over 10 models, showing the highest average scores. These countries have strong research environments, contributing to better transparency practices.
[ insert top 10 table]
- North America and Western Europe display wide variability, with many countries hosting both open models and highly opaque ones
- The United States, United Kingdom, and China have lower average transparency scores, likely driven by the inclusion of many closed-source or commercial models with limited documentation.
- Emerging countries, such as the UAE, show promising transparency scores but should be interpreted with caution due to limited model representation
- Higher transparency in some countries may reflect research collectives or open science initiatives, rather than policy mandates for transparency.
