- Open weight releases tend to foster greater transparency–possibly due to research norms, community scrutiny, or institutional values tied to openness.

- However, open access is not a guarantee for transparency. Some unreleased models are well-documented; while some open ones still lack critical input details. 

- Ultimately, transparency is not just about access to outputs (like weights or APIs) – it’s about traceability of inputs: how the model was trained, on what data and computation resources.
