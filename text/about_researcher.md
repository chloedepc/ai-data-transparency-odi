### ***Chloé Depolla***

I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Business Analytics at University College London, with a background in economics from McGill University and a growing interest in the intersection of data, governance, and social impact. 

The rapid evolution of AI was one of the key factors that drew me to data science and analytics in the first place. I’ve always been curious about how we make intricate systems more interpretable, and how information asymmetries can be challenged through better design, communication, and policy. I’m particularly passionate about creating visual narratives and transforming complex data into accessible, actionable insights—especially for audiences who may not have a technical background but deserve to understand the systems that affect them.
