The dataset used in the following visuals is based on a curated sample from Epoch AIâ€™s dataset (as of July 2025). It includes selected fields that are most relevant and interpretable for the purpose of transparency analysis and visualization. Some transformations were applied to improve consistency and clarity, and not all original fields from the full Epoch AI dataset are represented here (although all 900+ rows have been preserved.) 

Each record provides structured metadata on widely recognized models, focusing on three main areas:

- **Model Identification and Attribution:** includes key information to identify each model, such as name, developer organization(s), publication date, country and region of origin, organization type, and link to the original publication of the model for reference. 

- **Model Inputs and Accessibility:** Covers technical details essential to transparency analysis, such as training dataset and size, training compute, number of parameters, and how the model is made accessible to users (e.g., via API or open weights)

- **Special Cases and Metadata Context:** Captures information specific to fine-tuned models (e.g., base model and finetune compute), as well as confidence ratings and explanatory notes that clarify the reliability or source of recorded values.
